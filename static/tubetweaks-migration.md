# YTShareAntiTrack is now TubeTweaks
Very sorry if this page opening is in any way inconvenient right now, but this is actually important! It won't open again ^^
<br><br>

### What Happened
Development of YTShareAntiTrack has shifted from a userscript to an actual proper standalone browser extension called TubeTweaks. 
<br><br>
Making it an extension has several benefits. There are more features now, and performance is greatly improved, due to being able to intercept network requests (not available on chrome/chromium, they still use the old system).
<br><br>
In the future, many more features will be added to TubeTweaks, even outside of just share button shenanigans!
<br><br>
Also, now there's this whole "XenoExtensions" thing. Don't worry, I'm still the same author, this is just the umbrella I decided to put all my future extensions under.
<br><br>

### Do I need to move?
Moving to TubeTweaks is highly encouraged, but not strictly necessary. YTShareAntiTrack will keep working, and keep receiving updates if things break.<br>
However, it will not receive any improvements. 
<br><br>
Also, TubeTweaks is just objectively better :)
